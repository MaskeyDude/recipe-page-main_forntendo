# Overview

Meh I don't like the look of table of contents but I guess they're nice...?

## The challenge

Well replicate this as closely as I can... *sigh*
[Recipe page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm)

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

- Ahm... I already did try tables but now know how to actually use them ._.

- How to color only the marker/number of a list!!

```css
ol li::marker {
    font-weight: bold;
    color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
}
```

- Finally fixed fonts not apprearing in firefox (Just change default/other fonts to basic ones: Serif, sans-serif & monospace)

- That I really like this method of using fonts:

```css 
@import url();
/* font-family: ; */
```

### Continued development

I really like front end projects but I just get kinda overwhelmed on where to start after seeing a fresh blank project. Well.. I also like writing readme.md and only started avoiding them as I got confused. So now I'm not really gonna focus on finishing stuff instead just do as much as I wanna yeah as at the end of the day it's for practice anyway :>


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
