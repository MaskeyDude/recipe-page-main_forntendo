## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

- Ahm... I already did try tables but now know how to actually use them ._.

- How to color only the marker/number of a list!!

```css
ol li::marker {
    font-weight: bold;
    color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
}
```

- Finally fixed fonts not apprearing in firefox (Just change default/other fonts to basic ones: Serif, sans-serif & monospace)

- That I really like...

```css 
@import url();
/* font-family: ; */
```

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
