# Overview

Meh I don't like the look of table of contents but I guess they're nice...?

## My process

I left it for a long time then remembered again and realized that I actually enjoy it lol. I did the html stuff first then css ... yeah

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

- Ahm... I already did try tables but now know how to actually use them ._.

- How to color only the marker/number of a list!!

```css
ol li::marker {
    font-weight: bold;
    color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
}
```

- Finally fixed fonts not apprearing in firefox (Just change default/other fonts to basic ones: Serif, sans-serif & monospace)

- That I really like this method of using fonts:

```css 
@import url();
/* font-family: ; */
```

- Finally remembered this blank thingy:
```html
<a href="#" target="_blank">This link will open in another tab</a>
```

### Continued development

I really like front end projects but I just get kinda overwhelmed on where to start after seeing a fresh blank project. Well.. I also like writing readme.md and only started avoiding them as I got confused. So now I'm not really gonna focus on finishing stuff instead just do as much as I wanna yeah as at the end of the day it's for practice anyway :>
